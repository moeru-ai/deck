## Contributing

Welcome! If you just want to improve an existing character, feel free to open a PR.

If you want to add a new character, it's mostly up to my interest whether I accept it or not.

**However, here are a few types that are explicitly not accepted:**

1. **Male Characters**.
2. **Realistic Characters**, this repository only contains fictional characters.
3. **HoYoverse Characters**, since there are already plenty of them online, I don't think more are needed.

### Original

Contributions of original characters are not accepted at this time.

### Touhou Project

> TODO

For the Touhou Project character, I'd suggest referencing EraTohoTW.

But please try to avoid using "<ruby>口上<rp>(</rp><rt>Kōjō</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>" directly. if you use, make sure that the license (`./ERB/口上・メッセージ関連/個人口上/**/ライセンステンプレ.txt`) allows for both "era 以外への流用" and "二次創作".

### Visual Novel

> TODO

Use official Twitter avatars whenever possible, products with official English translations are preferred.

For PLists, it is recommended to refer to the vndb characters page.

When contributing a character, please make sure you have purchased the corresponding game.

If I receive a DMCA takedown notice, I will remove the character as requested.
