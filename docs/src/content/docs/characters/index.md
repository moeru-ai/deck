You need to first install a LLM front-end like [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern) / [RisuAI](https://github.com/kwaroran/RisuAI) that supports role cards and set up the API correctly.

After this, simply head over to the corresponding character page, click "Download JSON" to download character card (we are currently unable to provide PNG role cards), and import it in the LLM front end.
